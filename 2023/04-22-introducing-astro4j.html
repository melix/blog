<p>This blog introduces <a href="https://github.com/melix/astro4j">astro4j</a>, my latest toy project, a open source collection of libraries and applications for astronomy, written in Java.
In particular, I will discuss <a href="https://github.com/melix/astro4j/tree/main/jsolex">JSol&#8217;Ex</a>, a program aimed at reconstructing solar disk images from video files captured using the amazing <a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/solex/sol-ex-presentation-en.html">Sol&#8217;Ex</a> instrument.</p>

<h2 id="_why_astro4j">Why astro4j?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m a software developer, and if you are following me, you may also know that I&#8217;m an <a href="https://www.astrobin.com/users/melix/">amateur astrophotographer</a>.
For a long time, I&#8217;ve been fascinated by the quality of software we have in astronomy, to process images.
If you are french speaking, you can watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgnOtdjVHs">presentation I gave about this topic</a>.
Naturally, I have been curious about how all these things work, but it&#8217;s actually extremely rare to find open source software, and when you do, it&#8217;s rarely written in Java.
For example, both <a href="http://www.firecapture.de/">Firecapture</a> (software to capture video streams) and <a href="https://www.astropixelprocessor.com/">Astro Pixel Processor</a> are written in Java, but both of them are closed source, commercial software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last month, for my birthday, I got a <a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/solex/sol-ex-presentation-en.html">Sol&#8217;Ex</a>, an instrument which combines spectrography and software to realize amazing solar pictures in different spectral lines.
To process those images, the easiest solution is to use <a href="http://valerie.desnoux.free.fr/inti/">the amazing INTI software</a>, written in Python, but for which sources are not published, as far as I know, neither on GitHub or GitLab.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<td class="content">
After announcing this project, I have been notified that the sources of INTI <a href="https://github.com/Vdesnoux/Solex_ser_recon">are indeed available, as GPL</a>. It&#8217;s a pity they are not linked on the webpage, this would have helped a lot.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To give you an example of what you can do, here&#8217;s the <a href="https://www.astrobin.com/94gymd/">first photography</a> I&#8217;ve done with Sol&#8217;Ex and processed with INTI (color was added in Gimp):</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get this result, one has to combine images which look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/blog/img/astro/solex/spectrum.png" alt="spectrum">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interesting, no?
At the same time, I was a bit frustrated by INTI.
While it clearly does the job and is extremely easy to use, there are a few things which I didn&#8217;t like:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the first, which I mentioned, is that it&#8217;s using Python and that the sources are not published (as far as I understand, some algorithms are not published yet). I am not surprised that Python is used, because it&#8217;s a language which is extremely popular in academics, with lots of libraries for image processing, science oriented libs, etc. However, because it&#8217;s popular in academics also means that programs are often written by and for academics. When we&#8217;re talking about maths, it&#8217;s often short variable names, cryptic function names, etc&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>second, after processing, INTI pops up a lot of images as individual windows. If you want to process a new file, you have to close all of them. The problem is that I still haven&#8217;t figured out in which order you have to do this so that you can restart from the initial window which lets you select a video file! Apparently, depending on the order, it will, or will not, show the selector. And sometimes, it takes several seconds before it does so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>INTI seems to be regenerating a font cache every time I reboot. This operation takes several minutes. It&#8217;s probably an artifact of packaging the application for Windows, but still, not very user friendly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>INTI generates a number of images, but puts them alongside the videos. I like things organized (well, at least virtually, because if you looked at my desk right now, it is likely you&#8217;d feel faint), so I wish it was creating one directory per processed video.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="_confronting_the_old_demons">Confronting the old demons</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I started studying at University, back in 1998, I was planning to do astrophysics.
However, I quickly forgot about this idea when I saw the amount of maths one has to master to do modern physics.
Clearly, I was reaching my limits, and it was extremely complicated for me.
Fortunately, I had been doing software development for years already, because I started very young, on my father&#8217;s computer.
So I decided to switch to computer science, where I was reasonably successful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, not being able to do what I wanted to do has always been a frustration. It is still, today, to the point that a lot of what I&#8217;m reading is about this topic, but still, I lack the maths.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was time for me to confront my old demons, and answer a few questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>am I still capable of understanding maths, in order to implement algorithms which I use everyday when I do astronomy image processing with software written by others?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can I read academic papers, for example to implement a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm, although I clearly remember that I failed to understand the principles when I was at school?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can I do this while writing something which could be useful to others, and publish it as open source software?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Astro4j is there to answer those questions.
I don&#8217;t have the answers yet and time will tell if I&#8217;m successful.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_using_modern_java">Using modern Java</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One question you may have is why Java? If you are not familiar with this language, you may have this old misconception that Java is slow.
It&#8217;s not. Especially, if you compare to Python, it&#8217;s definitely not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project is also for me a way to prove that you can implement "serious science" in Java.
You can already find some science libraries in Java, but they tend to me impractical to use, because not following the industry standards (e.g published on Maven Central) or platform-dependent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also wanted to leverage this to <em>learn something new</em>.
So this project:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>uses Java 17 (at least for libraries, so that they can be consumed by a larger number of developers, for applications I&#8217;m considering moving to Java 20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>uses <a href="https://openjfx.io/">JavaFX</a> (OpenJFX) for the application UI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>experiments with the <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/438">Vector API</a> for faster processing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I said, my initial goal is to obtain a software which can basically do what INTI does.
It is not a goal to make it faster, but if I can do it, I will.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introducing_jsolex">Introducing JSol&#8217;Ex</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a few evenings (and a couple week-ends ;)), I already have something which performs <em>basic processing</em>, that is to say that it can process a SER video file and generate a reconstructed solar disk.
It does <strong>not</strong> perform geometry correction, nor tilt correction, like INTI does. It doesn&#8217;t generate shifted images either (for example the doppler images), but <strong>it works</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the only source of information I had to do this was <a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/solex/sol-ex-presentation-en.html">Christian Buil&#8217;s website</a> and <a href="http://valerie.desnoux.free.fr/inti/">Valérie Desnoux INTI&#8217;s website</a>, I basically had to implement my own algorithms from A to Z, and just "guess" how it works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to do this, I had to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>implement a SER video file decoder. The library is <a href="https://github.com/melix/astro4j/tree/main/jserfile">ready</a> and performs both decoding the SER file and performs demosaicing of images</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on top of the decoder, I implemented a <a href="https://github.com/melix/astro4j/tree/main/ser-player">SER file player</a>, which is still very basic at this stage, and uses JavaFX. This player can even be compiled to a native binary using <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
</div>
 <video width="800" height="480" controls>
  <source src="https://melix.github.io/blog/img/astro/solex/serplayer.webm" type="video/webm">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then I could finally start working on the Sol&#8217;Ex video processor.
As I said, I don&#8217;t know how INTI works, so this is all trial and error, in the end&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the beginning, as I said, you have a SER video file which contains a lot of frames (for example, in my case, it&#8217;s a file from 500MB to 1GB) that we have to process in order to generate a solar disk.
Each frame consists of a view of the light spectrum, centered on a particular spectral line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, in the following image, we have the H-alpha spectral line:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/blog/img/astro/solex/spectrum.png" alt="spectrum">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of optics, you can see that the line is not horizontal: each frame is distorted.
Therefore, in order to reconstruct an image, we have to deal with that distortion first.
For this, we have to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>detect the spectral line in the frame, which I&#8217;m doing by implementing a simple contrast detection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>perform a linear regression in order to compute a 2d order polynomial which models the distortion</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that before doing this, I had no idea how to do a 2d order regression, but I searched and found that it was possible to do so using the least squares method, so I did so.
The result is that we can identify precisely the line with this technique:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/blog/img/astro/solex/spectrum-line.png" alt="spectrum line">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the beginning, I tought I would have to perform distortion correction in order to reconstruct the image, because I was (wrongly) assuming that, because each frame represents <em>one</em> line in the reconstructed image, I had to compute the average of the colums of each frame to determine the color of a <em>single</em> pixel in the output. I was wrong (we&#8217;ll come to that later), but I did implement a distortion correction algorithm:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/blog/img/astro/solex/spectrum-corrected.png" alt="spectrum corrected">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I computed the average, the resulting image was far from the quality and constrast of what I got with INTI.
What a failure!
So I thought that maybe I had to compute the average of the spectral line itself.
I tried this, and indeed, the resulting image was much better, but still not the quality of INTI.
The last thing I did, therefore, was to pick the middle of the spectral line itself, and then, magically, I got the same level of quality as with INTI (for the raw images, as I said I didn&#8217;t implement any geometry or tilt correction yet).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason I was assuming that I had to compute an average, is that it wasn&#8217;t clear to me that the <em>absorption ray</em> would actually contain enough data to reconstruct an image.
As it was an absorption ray, I assumed that the value would be 0, and therefore that nothing would come out of using the ray itself.
In fact, my physics were wrong, and you <em>must</em> use that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A direct consequence is that there is actually no need to perform a distortion correction.
Instead, you can just use the 2d order polynomial that we&#8217;ve computed, and "follow the line", that&#8217;s it!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, we can generate an image, but it will be very dark.
The reason is obvious: by taking the middle of the spectral line, we&#8217;re basically using dark pixels, so the dynamics of the image are extremely low.
So, in order to have something which "looks nice", you actually have to perform brightness correction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first algorithm I have used is simply a linear correction: we&#8217;re computing the max and min value of the image, then rescaling that so that the max value is the maximum representable (255).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s the result:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/blog/img/astro/solex/linear.png" alt="linear">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, I felt that this technique wouldn&#8217;t give the best results, in particular because linear images tend to give results which are not what the eye would see: our eye performs a bit like an "exponential" accumulator, the more photos you get, the "brighter" we&#8217;ll see it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I implemented another algorithm which I had seen in <a href="https://pixinsight.com/">PixInsight</a>, which is called inverse hyperbolic (Arcsinh) correction:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/blog/img/astro/solex/streched.png" alt="streched">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last, you can see that the image has lots of vertical line artifacts.
This is due to the presence of dust either on the optics or the sensors.
INTI performs correction of those lines, and I wanted to do something similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, I don&#8217;t know what INTI is doing, so I figured out my own technique, which is using "multipass" correction.
In a nutshell, for each row, I am computing the average value of the row.
Then, for a particular row, I compute the average of the averages of the surrounding lines (for example, 16 rows before and after).
If the average of this line is <em>below</em> the average of the averages(!), then I&#8217;m considering that the line is darker than it should be, computing a correction factor and applying it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result is a corrected image:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/blog/img/astro/solex/banding.png" alt="banding">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;re still not a the level of quality that INTI produces, but getting close!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what&#8217;s next? I already have <a href="https://github.com/melix/astro4j/issues">added some issues for things I want to fix</a>, and in particular, I&#8217;m looking at improving the banding reduction and performing geometry correction.
For both, I <em>think</em> I will need to use fast fourier transforms, in order to identify the noise in one case (banding) and detect edges in the other (geometry correction).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, I started to implement FFT transforms, a domain I had absolutely no knowledge of.
Luckily, I could ask <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> to explain to me the concepts, which made it faster to implement!
For now, I have only implemented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm">Cooley-Tukey</a> algorithm.
The issue is that this algorithm is quite slow, and requires that the input data has a length which is a power of 2.
Given the size of the image we generate, it&#8217;s quite costly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I took advantage of this to learn about the <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/438">Vector API</a> to leverage SIMD instructions of modern CPUs, and it indeed made things significantly faster (about twice as fast), but still not at the level of performance that I expect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am trying to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-radix_FFT_algorithm">split radix</a> but I&#8217;m clearly intimidated by the many equations here&#8230;&#8203; In any case I printed some papers which I hope I&#8217;ll be able to understand.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In conclusion, in this article, I&#8217;ve introduced <a href="https://github.com/melix/astro4j">astro4j</a>, an open source suite of libraries and applications written in Java for astronomy software.
While the primary goal for me is to learn and improve my skills and knowledge of the maths behind astronomy software processing, it <em>may</em> be that it produces something useful.
In any case, since it&#8217;s open source, if you want to contribute, feel free!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And you can do so in different domains, for example, I pretty much s* at UI, so if you are a JavaFX expert, I would appreciate your pull requests!</p>
