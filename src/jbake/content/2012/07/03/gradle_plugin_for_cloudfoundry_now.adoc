gradle-cf-plugin upgraded to 0.2
--------------------------------

I have just published a new version of the http://www.gradle.org[Gradle] plugin for link:[CloudFoundry]. The main change is that it supports standalone applications, meaning you will be able to push your applications to CloudFoundry all from Gradle.

To deploy a standalone application, you can do the following:

[source]
----
buildscript {
       repositories {
         mavenCentral()
       }
       dependencies {
           classpath group: 'org.gradle.api.plugins', name: 'gradle-cf-plugin', version: '0.2.0'
       }
   }

   apply plugin: 'cloudfoundry'

----


Then add to your _build.gradle_ file a section describing your deployment settings (note the _standalone_ framework):

[source]
----
cloudfoundry {
   target='http://api.vcap.me'
   username = 'user-AT-domain-DOT-com'
   password='foobar'
   application = 'myapp'
   framework = 'standalone'
   applicationFramework='standalone'
   runtime = 'java'
   command = "$name/bin/$name"
   file = distZip.archivePath
   uris = ['http://myurl.vcap.me']
   memory = 256
}

----


If you migrate your application from version 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 of the plugin, then you have to change the _warFile_ property to _file_. Now, you are able to push your application to CloudFoundry using the _cf-push_ task:

--------------
gradle cf-push
--------------

Note that in future versions of the plugin, we will likely change the name of the tasks so that they follow the Gradle conventions (using, for example, _cfPush_ instead of _cf-push_).
