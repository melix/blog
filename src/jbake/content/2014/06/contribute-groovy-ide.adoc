Often people ask us how you can setup a development environment to contribute on the Groovy project. If you use IntelliJ IDEA, it's actually very easy, so I decided to make a video for it. It's my first screencast ever, I think I will try to do more in the future, so please excuse my hesitations and enjoy! You'll notice that apparently Google Hangouts dislikes my face, but hopefully, the screensharing stuff worked ;-)

Here's the video:

Of course, you can ask me if you have issues with the setup, but it should really be straightforward!
