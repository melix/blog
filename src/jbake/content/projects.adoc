My daily job is working on the http://groovy.codehaus.org[Groovy language]. However, I also published several projects on https://github.com/melix?tab=repositories[GitHub] you might be interested in.

* https://github.com/melix/deck2pdf[deck2pdf] is a tool aimed at converting HTML5 slide decks to PDF. Some conference organizers or slide publication sites like http://www.parleys.com/[Parleys] only support PDF. Does it mean that you are condemned to use _OpenOffice_, _LibreOffice_ or _PowerPoint_? Certainly not. Install https://github.com/melix/deck2pdf[deck2pdf] and you should be happy. It supports multiple HTML5 slideware, such as http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/[deck.js], http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js[reveal.js], http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js[impress.js], https://github.com/paulrouget/dzslides[DZSlides], http://flowtime-js.marcolago.com/[Flowtime.js], http://code.google.com/p/html5slides/[Google html5slides] and https://github.com/briancavalier/slides[Slide Presentation Framework].
* https://github.com/melix/teamcity-groovy-buildstep[Groovy for TeamCity] is a plugin for http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/[TeamCity] which will let you write build steps in Groovy. We used it for the official http://ci.groovy-lang.org?guest=1[Groovy continuous integration server].
* https://github.com/melix/jlangdetect[JLangDetect] is a library for the JVM, aimed at language recognition. It includes a learner and pre-configured recognition profiles.
* https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake-gradle-plugin[JBake plugin for Gradle] is a Gradle plugin which makes it very easy to render http://jbake.org[JBake] site directly from http://www.gradle.org[Gradle]. A full description of the process can be found in link:/blog/2014/02/hosting-jbake-github.html[this post].
* https://github.com/melix/groovy-bytecode-ast[A @Bytecode AST transformation for Groovy]. This one is an experiment I made, which allows writing bytecode directly in a Groovy method body. Not safe for work :-)
* https://github.com/melix/asm-bytecode-intellij[An ASM bytecode plugin for IntelliJ]. This plugin adds a bytecode tool window to IntelliJ, with various options for viewing the bytecode of a Java class, including ASMified and Groovified.

And a lot more... just take a look at my https://github.com/melix[GitHub profile].
